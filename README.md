# ISL Rocket Design Project 🚀

This project was created as part of the India Space Lab (ISL) Summer Internship 2025.

## 📄 Description
A model rocket was designed and simulated using OpenRocket software. The rocket achieved an apogee of ~820 meters using a J-class motor, with a stability margin of ~2 calibers and a parachute descent rate of 3.7 m/s.
